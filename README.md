# Leap_Motion_Mouse

This is a hack I developed during Nhacks 2016. It turns your hand into a mouse using the leap motion.

Moving the mouse - Index Finger.

Single Click - Infront of the leap motion, tap thumb and index finger together.

Double Click - Behind the leap motion, tap thumb and index finger together.

Drag Mouse - Fist and move however you like. To get out of a drag, you can just release your fist.

Scroll Up - Motion your hand downwards with palm facing down.

Scroll Down - Motion your hand upward with palm facing down.

Zoom in - Create a circular loop clockwise.

Zoom out- Create a circular loop counter-clockwise.
